groups into consideration. The list of the customer groups can be set in backend.
Also one can set such parameters as 'Minimum Order Total', 'Maximum Order Total',
and 'New Order Status'.

       The list of the user groups for "Symmetrics invoice"
       can be configured in backend.
*** C: "Maximum Order Total" and "Minimum Order Total" settings
       can be configured in backend.
*** D: For each new order there is a possibility to configure 
        order status in backend.

       in backend under "System" -> "Configuration" -> "Sales" 
       -> "Payment methods" -> "Symmetrics invoice"
        1. 'Activated'
        2. 'Title'
        3. 'New order status' (see item D)
